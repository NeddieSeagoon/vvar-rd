## Purpose
Provide data on game mechanics to VVAR leadership for use in development of SOPs and TTPs, and as needed for specific operations.
<br> <br>
These data must be:
- accurate and reliable. Appropriate testing must carried out based on the nature of the mechanic in question (level of stochasticity) 
- current. Mechanics that may have been affected by a game update should be re-tested.
- clear and relevant. Results of tests should be communicated as simply as possible, and their use in VVAR operations should be clear.

# Pending Tests

### Vehicle Detection
- Current baseline data for all vehicles
    - ongoing effort. 
    - Some vehicles may have higher priority at a given time - described in the [vehicle priority list](docs/vehicle-priority-list.md)
- Lowest-signature loadouts for ground vehicles
    - Gravlev
    - Nova
    - Atlas platform
    - Wheeled
- EM and IR decay rate over time
    - per component?
    - affected by hull?
- Function for detection range based on ground vehicle emissions
- [Multipliers by radar size](docs/radar-size-multipliers.md)
### Deployment
- HALO test all vehicles
- LAPES test all vehicles
